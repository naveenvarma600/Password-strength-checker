# Password-strength-checker

-This website helps user to check the strength of a password that is entered
-All the logic to check the strength of password is in the auth/validators.py (using 're')                
                
                
                
-**TIPS**:                
  1)**Six** is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library. It provides utility functions for smoothing over the differences between the Python versions with the goal of writing Python code that is compatible on both Python versions.                                
  2)**pytz** brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows accurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4 or higher.                 
  3)**ASGI** is a standard for Python asynchronous web apps and servers to communicate with each other, and positioned as an asynchronous successor to WSGI. You can read more at https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/                
  4)REST implementation of Django authentication system. **djoser** library provides a set of Django Rest Framework views to handle basic actions such as registration, login, logout, password reset and account activation. It works with custom user model.  
                  
                  
                  
  -**Future Works**                
    1) Change the style files so that website becomes **RESPONSIVE**                
    2) Try to add a blend of Machine Learning , use an **ML model** to predict the strength of password.
